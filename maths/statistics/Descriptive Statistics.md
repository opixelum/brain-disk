## Mean

- Arithmetic average of a set of numbers.

$$\text{Mean} (\mu) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}$$

## Median

- Middle value when a data set is ordered from least to greatest.
- If there is a even number of values:
$$\text{Median} = \frac{\text{Middle value 1} + \text{Middle value 2}}{2}$$

## Mode

- Most frequently occurring value in a dataset.

## Range

- Difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.

## Quartiles

- Values that divide the data into four equal parts.
- **First Quartile (Q1)**: Median of the lower half of the dataset;
- **Second Quartile (Q2)**: Median of the entire dataset;
- **Third Quartile (Q3)**: Median of the upper half of the dataset.

## Interquartile Range

Range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3).

## Variance

- Value of the squared deviation from the mean of a random variable.

$$\text{Variance} (\sigma^2) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2}{N}$$

## Standard Deviation

- Square root of the variance;
- Shows how spread out the data points are from the mean. The lower it is, the closer values tend to be from the mean.

$$\text{Standard Deviation} (\sigma) = \sqrt{\text{Variance}}$$
